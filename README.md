As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, deep learning-based image recognition has emerged as a critical technology in fields like healthcare, security, and autonomous systems. Among these, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in applications such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition. However, the computational demands of CNNs‚Äîstemming from their reliance on matrix multiplications and accumulation operations‚Äîpose significant challenges, particularly in real-time processing scenarios.

### Objective
This project aims to develop a **hardware-accelerated CNN processing system** that:
1. Enhances computation speed by leveraging parallel processing through an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design.
2. Reduces power consumption by introducing reusable and optimized hardware modules.
3. Delivers high performance suitable for real-time applications while maintaining resource efficiency.

By utilizing the **OpenRoad Tool** in a Linux environment, we designed, implemented, and validated a virtual ASIC capable of executing CNN operations such as convolution, activation, pooling, and fully connected layer computations. The project highlights modularity, scalability, and efficiency to address the growing demand for hardware-accelerated AI solutions.
